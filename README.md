Today is the first day I am trying to create a tic-tac-toe game. Today, I managed to make the game in the console, but it is not perfect and has some aspects that need to be fixed.

On June 3, 2024, I refactored everything into functions, added exception handling, but some errors remained. I also forgot to account for a draw.

On June 8th, I finished the code and decided to see what ChatGPT would say about it. ChatGPT created its own version of the game.

The next step for me is to create the game using Windows Forms.
